Here is a summary of the basic git commands : 

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the original repository on GitHub to create your personal copy. This allows you to modify the code independently.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using GitHub Desktop, enabling you to make changes locally.

3. **Edit a File**: Open the `README.md` file in your local clone and add a personalized line. Save the changes.

4. **Add and Commit Changes**: Use GitHub Desktop to add the modified `README.md` file and commit the change with a descriptive commit message.

5. **Create a Folder and a File**: Create a new folder in your local repository and add a Jupyter Notebook that generates a sine wave plot using Python.

6. **Add and Commit New Files**: Add and commit the new Jupyter Notebook using GitHub Desktop with an appropriate commit message.

7. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub, making your changes available online.

8. **Inspect Changes on GitHub**: Visit your fork on GitHub to verify that the `README.md` file and Jupyter Notebook are updated and correctly rendered.

9. **Pull Remote Changes**: Make a change directly on GitHub, then pull the change into your local repository to synchronize it.

10. **Discard and Revert Changes**: Learn how to discard uncommitted changes or revert a committed mistake using GitHub Desktop, ensuring your code remains error-free.

These steps cover the basic workflows for managing a single-person project with Git and GitHub.
